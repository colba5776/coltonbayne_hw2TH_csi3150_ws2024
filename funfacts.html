                Dark and Stormy Knight</a> explores Batman's motivations and actions, as
                well as those of his foes. Dr. Langley investigates what happens when childhood trauma is untreated in the Dark
                Knight's life, and how villains helped to shape his crime-fighting identity.

                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKwVFWwA_x8">Invisible</a> by Duran Duran is one of my favorite songs. It is a song about
                being invisible and how it can be a good thing. It is a song that I can relate to because I sometimes feel like a shy
                person and I often feel invisible.
